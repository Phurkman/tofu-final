            <div class="two-column-layout">
                <p class="text">Tofu has a history that goes back over 2,000 years. It dates back to the Western Han
                    Dynasty, which lasted from 206 BCE to 9 CE. It was allegedly created on accident by a Chinese prince
                    who was experimenting with soybeans and accidentally curdled them. Since then, tofu has had a
                    special place in Chinese culture and is found throughout Chinese cuisine. It’s also a dish that is
                    typically prepared during the Chinese Lunar New Year. The food is said to bring good luck and
                    fortune to the family. Early on, tofu was considered a luxury food item, one that was only served to
                    royalty and wealthy families. It was also considered a medicinal food in ancient China, known for
                    alleviating digestive problems and strengthening the body.</p>

                <p class="text">Today, tofu is an incredibly popular ingredient in vegan and vegetarian diets and is used in many
                    dishes worldwide. Tofu’s versatility and nutrients make it an excellent health food for any diet.
                    Not only does tofu have a high amount of protein, but it also contains plenty of vitamins like
                    calcium and iron. Tofu’s benefits are further enhanced by its phytoestrogen content. The
                    phytoestrogen content is said to reduce heart disease and osteoporosis.
