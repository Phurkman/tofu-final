        <h2>What is tofu?</h2>
        <p>Tofu, or soybean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the resulting curds into soft,
            white blocks. It is made from soybeans, water, and a coagulant like calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride,
            and is a versatile and complete protein source that can be baked, fried, or added to soups and stir-fries.
            Tofu has a mild, neutral flavor that readily absorbs the taste of other ingredients it's cooked with. </p>

        <h2>FIRM</h2>
        <P>
            Firm tofu has a solid, dense texture and is more tender than extra-firm varieties, making it ideal for
            versatile cooking methods like stir-frying, grilling, and baking. It holds its shape well, but it benefits
            from pressing to remove excess liquid, which allows it to absorb marinades and get crispier when cooked.
        </P>
        <h2>EXTRA FIRM</h2>
        <P>
            Extra-firm tofu is a dense, water-pressed form of tofu with a chewy texture, high protein content, and
            neutral flavor, making it versatile for recipes where a firm, meat-like consistency is desired. It is
            well-suited for frying, baking, and grilling because its low moisture content helps it crisp up and hold its
            shape better than other varieties. It is an excellent dairy-free and plant-based protein source for dishes
            like stir-fries, kebabs, and nuggets.
        </P>
        <h2>SILKEN TOFU</h2>
        <P>
            Silken tofu is a very soft, creamy, and wobbly type of tofu made from unpressed, undrained soy milk that has
            been coagulated. Unlike firm tofu, it is not pressed to remove water, resulting in a higher water content
            and a texture that is often compared to a thick cream or pudding. Its mild flavor and smooth consistency
            make it ideal for use in dips, sauces, smoothies, desserts, and as a creamy base for vegan cheesecakes and
            other baked goods.
