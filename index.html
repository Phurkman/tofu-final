                <p class="text">Tofu, or soybean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the resulting
                    curds into soft,
                    white blocks. It is made from soybeans, water, and a coagulant like calcium sulfate or magnesium
                    chloride,
                    and is a versatile and complete protein source that can be baked, fried, or added to soups and
                    stir-fries.
                    Tofu has a mild, neutral flavor that readily absorbs the taste of other ingredients it's cooked
                    with.

            <h2 class="main-header-firm">FIRM</h2>
            <P class="text">
                Firm tofu has a solid, dense texture and is more tender than extra-firm varieties, making it ideal for
                versatile cooking methods like stir-frying, grilling, and baking. It holds its shape well, but it
                benefits
                from pressing to remove excess liquid, which allows it to absorb marinades and get crispier when cooked.
            </P>
            <h2 class="main-header-extrafirm">EXTRA FIRM</h2>
            <P class="text">
                Extra-firm tofu is a dense, water-pressed form of tofu with a chewy texture, high protein content, and
                neutral flavor, making it versatile for recipes where a firm, meat-like consistency is desired. It is
                well-suited for frying, baking, and grilling because its low moisture content helps it crisp up and hold
                its
                shape better than other varieties. It is an excellent dairy-free and plant-based protein source for
                dishes
                like stir-fries, kebabs, and nuggets.
            </P>
            <h2 class="main-header-silken">Silken Tofu</h2>
            <P class="text">
                Silken tofu is a very soft, creamy, and wobbly type of tofu made from unpressed, undrained soy milk that
                has
                been coagulated. Unlike firm tofu, it is not pressed to remove water, resulting in a higher water
                content
                and a texture that is often compared to a thick cream or pudding. Its mild flavor and smooth consistency
                make it ideal for use in dips, sauces, smoothies, desserts, and as a creamy base for vegan cheesecakes
                and
                other baked goods.
